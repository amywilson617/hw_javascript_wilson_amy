*The only helpful resource I used was our instructor, Nick Page.

*I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment, other than mentioned above.

*I	reviewed	the	list	of	deductions	for	this	project
and	in	the	syllabus.

*This is the hardest assignment I have done in my time at UF!

*I tried really hard, but feel disappointed in my struggle with this.
